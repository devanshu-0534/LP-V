🔍 Code Explanation
🔧 Headers and Namespace
cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <omp.h>
using namespace std;
iostream, vector, and queue are standard C++ libraries.

omp.h is used to enable OpenMP — a library for parallel programming.

🚀 Function: parallelBFS
cpp
Copy
Edit
void parallelBFS(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int start)
This function performs a parallel BFS (Breadth-First Search) starting from node start in the graph.

🏗️ Initialization
cpp
Copy
Edit
int n = graph.size();
vector<bool> visited(n, false);
queue<int> q;
vector<int> traversalOrder;
visited[start] = true;
q.push(start);
visited: Keeps track of visited nodes.

q: Standard BFS queue.

traversalOrder: Records the exact order nodes were visited in (for final output).

🔁 While loop: Traverse Level by Level
cpp
Copy
Edit
while (!q.empty()) {
    int sz = q.size();
    vector<int> currentLevel;
Processes nodes in BFS layers.

sz: Number of nodes in current level.

currentLevel: Stores nodes discovered in this level to be added to the queue later.

🧵 Parallel processing using OpenMP
cpp
Copy
Edit
#pragma omp parallel for shared(q, visited)
for (int i = 0; i < sz; ++i)
This loop is parallelized using OpenMP.

Each thread tries to process a node from the current level.

🔒 Critical Section to Pop from Queue
cpp
Copy
Edit
#pragma omp critical
{
    if (!q.empty()) {
        u = q.front(); q.pop();
        cout << "Visited: " << u << endl;
        traversalOrder.push_back(u);
    }
}
Only one thread at a time can pop from the queue due to #pragma omp critical.

It prints and stores the node.

🔄 Visit Neighbors
cpp
Copy
Edit
for (int v : graph[u]) {
    #pragma omp critical
    {
        if (!visited[v]) {
            visited[v] = true;
            currentLevel.push_back(v);
        }
    }
}
For each neighbor of node u, mark as visited and add to currentLevel (safely, using critical).

📥 Add Next Level to Queue
cpp
Copy
Edit
for (int v : currentLevel) q.push(v);
Once the level is fully processed, add its new nodes to the queue.

📋 Print Traversal Order
cpp
Copy
Edit
cout << "Traversal Order: ";
for (int node : traversalOrder) {
    cout << node << " ";
}
cout << endl;
After BFS finishes, this prints the order in which nodes were visited.

📊 Comparison: Parallel BFS vs Normal (Sequential) BFS
Feature	Normal BFS	Parallel BFS (Your Code)
Execution	Single-threaded	Multi-threaded via OpenMP
Order of Traversal	Deterministic (same every time)	Non-deterministic (depends on thread scheduling)
Speed	Slower for large graphs	Potentially faster on large graphs and multi-core CPUs
Complexity	Easier to implement and debug	Harder to manage due to race conditions and synchronization
Thread Safety	No concurrency issues	Needs #pragma omp critical for safe access
Use Case	Small to medium graphs	Large graphs with high branching factor

⚠️ Limitations in This Parallel Code
The use of #pragma omp critical serializes parts of the logic (e.g., queue access), reducing actual parallel benefit.

Thread-safe access to visited[] and queue still slows down performance.

Because multiple threads may process different nodes simultaneously, the order of visited nodes can vary between runs.

✅ Summary
Your code performs parallel BFS correctly using OpenMP, with some synchronization overhead to avoid race conditions. It's suitable for experimenting with parallel graph traversal, especially on large graphs, but keep in mind:

For small graphs, sequential BFS is faster and simpler.

For large graphs, optimizing parallel BFS to avoid contention (e.g., using thread-local queues or atomic operations) can lead to real performance gains.
