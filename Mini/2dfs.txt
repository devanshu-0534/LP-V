✅ FULL CODE EXPLANATION
1. Headers and Setup
cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <omp.h>
using namespace std;
``- `iostream` is for input/output.  
- `vector` is used for the adjacency list of the graph.  
- `stack` is used to simulate DFS.  
- `omp.h` enables **OpenMP**, which allows parallel processing.

---

### 2. **Function: `parallelDFS()`**
```cpp
void parallelDFS(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int start)
Takes an adjacency list representation of the graph.

Begins DFS from a given starting node start.

3. Initialization
cpp
Copy
Edit
int n = graph.size();
vector<bool> visited(n, false);
stack<int> s;
vector<int> traversalOrder;
s.push(start);
n is the number of nodes.

visited[] tracks if a node has been visited.

stack<int> s is the core structure for DFS (LIFO order).

traversalOrder records the order in which nodes are visited (for output).

4. Main DFS Loop
cpp
Copy
Edit
while (!s.empty()) {
    int u;
    #pragma omp critical
    {
        u = s.top(); s.pop();
    }
While there are nodes in the stack:

One thread at a time (critical section) pops the top node u from the stack.

This is needed because the stack is a shared resource and not thread-safe.

5. Visit Node
cpp
Copy
Edit
    if (!visited[u]) {
        visited[u] = true;
        cout << "Visited: " << u << endl;
        traversalOrder.push_back(u);
If node u has not been visited:

Mark it as visited.

Print and record the node.

6. Parallel For Loop to Push Neighbors
cpp
Copy
Edit
        #pragma omp parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[u].size(); ++i) {
            int v = graph[u][i];
            if (!visited[v]) {
                #pragma omp critical
                s.push(v);
            }
        }
This loop is parallelized: multiple threads process the neighbors of u.

For each neighbor v, if it's unvisited, push it to the stack safely using another critical section.

⚠️ This part is parallel, but pushing to the stack must be done safely (critical), which limits real speedup.

7. Print Traversal Order
cpp
Copy
Edit
cout << "Traversal Order: ";
for (int node : traversalOrder) {
    cout << node << " ";
}
cout << endl;
After the DFS is complete, print the full traversal order.

8. Main Function
cpp
Copy
Edit
int main() {
    int n, e;
    ...
}
Reads number of nodes and edges.

Constructs the adjacency list.

Reads undirected edges.

Calls the parallelDFS() function with the input graph.

⚙️ HOW PARALLEL DFS WORKS
DFS is inherently recursive and stack-based, so parallelizing it is challenging.

In this code:

Nodes are processed one at a time, but neighbor processing is parallelized.

Threads may compete to push to the shared stack.

#pragma omp critical ensures safe updates but may reduce parallel efficiency.

🔁 PARALLEL vs SEQUENTIAL DFS
Aspect	Sequential DFS	Parallel DFS (OpenMP)
Execution	Single thread	Multiple threads (shared memory)
Speed	Fast for small graphs	Potentially faster on large graphs
Traversal Order	Deterministic	Non-deterministic (due to thread scheduling)
Stack Management	Simple, single-threaded stack	Requires synchronization (critical)
Thread Safety	Not needed	Mandatory (for stack, visited)
Complexity	Easy	More complex due to concurrency

❓ KEY QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
1. What is the purpose of #pragma omp critical?
Answer: It ensures mutual exclusion—only one thread accesses a critical section at a time. This is necessary when accessing/modifying shared structures like the stack or visited[].

2. Why is DFS harder to parallelize than BFS?
Answer: DFS relies on deep recursive (or stack-based) paths, where each decision depends on the last. This makes it hard to split into independent tasks. BFS, on the other hand, processes full levels which are easier to parallelize.

3. Why does the traversal order vary in parallel DFS?
Answer: Due to multiple threads pushing neighbors to the stack in parallel, the order in which nodes are visited depends on thread execution timing, which is non-deterministic.

4. What are the downsides of using #pragma omp critical in this code?
Answer: It introduces serialization—only one thread can push or pop at a time, which limits parallel performance. If many threads wait for access, the benefit of parallelism is reduced.

5. When is parallel DFS actually useful?
Answer: It's useful when:

You're exploring many neighbors at each step (like in dense graphs).

You can modify the algorithm to work with task-based parallelism.

You're solving specific problems (like parallel tree traversal, or parallel graph analytics on large datasets).

✅ Summary
Your code performs a parallel DFS using OpenMP, with added support to record and display traversal order.

Parallel DFS is challenging due to stack dependency and synchronization overhead.

For learning and small-scale demos, it's great. But for performance, more advanced task-parallel or distributed approaches are needed.
