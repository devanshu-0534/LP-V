 FULL EXPLANATION OF THE CODE
🔧 Headers and Setup
cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>
using namespace std;
vector holds the array.

omp.h enables OpenMP, which allows you to execute different parts of the code in parallel.

📦 merge() Function
cpp
Copy
Edit
void merge(vector<int>& arr, int l, int m, int r)
Merges two sorted subarrays:

Left: arr[l..m]

Right: arr[m+1..r]

Uses two temporary vectors left[] and right[].

Merges them into the original array arr.

🧠 This is the classic merge step used in Merge Sort.

⚡ parallelMergeSort() Function
cpp
Copy
Edit
void parallelMergeSort(vector<int>& arr, int l, int r)
The core recursive merge sort logic.

Splits the array into two halves and recursively sorts each half in parallel:

cpp
Copy
Edit
#pragma omp parallel sections
{
    #pragma omp section
    parallelMergeSort(arr, l, m);
    #pragma omp section
    parallelMergeSort(arr, m + 1, r);
}
Once the two halves are sorted, it merges them using the merge() function.

💡 This parallelism is achieved using OpenMP sections, where each recursive call can be executed in a separate thread.

🏁 main() Function
cpp
Copy
Edit
int main() {
    ...
}
Reads the size and elements of the array.

Calls parallelMergeSort() on the entire array.

Prints the sorted array.

🧠 KEY CONCEPTS
Why Merge Sort is Good for Parallelization
Divide-and-conquer nature: splits work into independent tasks.

Recursive calls on left and right halves can run in parallel.

Merge phase is sequential but fast (linear time).

OpenMP sections
#pragma omp parallel sections creates parallel execution blocks.

Each section inside is executed by a different thread.

Very suitable for recursive problems like Merge Sort.

🔁 COMPARISON: Sequential vs Parallel Merge Sort
Feature	Sequential Merge Sort	Parallel Merge Sort (OpenMP)
Execution	Single thread	Multi-threaded using sections
Recursion	One call at a time	Two recursive calls in parallel
Speed	O(n log n), but single-core	Faster on large arrays and multi-core CPUs
Parallel Efficiency	None	High (especially on large inputs)
Use Cases	Small to medium datasets	Large datasets on multi-core systems

❓ KEY QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
1. Why is Merge Sort better suited for parallelization than Bubble Sort?
Answer: Merge Sort naturally divides the array into independent subproblems (left and right halves), allowing true parallel execution. Bubble Sort depends on adjacent element comparisons, which conflict in parallel environments.

2. What does #pragma omp parallel sections do?
Answer: It allows multiple code blocks (sections) to run concurrently on separate threads, making it ideal for splitting tasks in divide-and-conquer algorithms like Merge Sort.

3. Why is the merge step not parallelized?
Answer: The merge operation involves combining two sorted arrays into one. It is relatively fast (linear) and involves tight element-by-element logic, which makes it complex and inefficient to parallelize at this small scale.

4. Can too much parallelism hurt performance?
Answer: Yes. Recursive parallelism can lead to thread oversubscription (too many threads) and context-switching overhead, especially for small arrays. A good practice is to add a threshold like:

cpp
Copy
Edit
if (r - l > threshold) {
    // parallel sections
} else {
    // do sequentially
}
5. What is the time complexity of Parallel Merge Sort?
Answer:

Time Complexity (same as sequential): O(n log n)

Parallel Time: Can approach O(log n) depth on ideal hardware with enough threads, though actual performance depends on system and input size.

✅ SUMMARY
Your code demonstrates a clean and effective implementation of parallel merge sort using OpenMP.

This is real-world parallelization, suitable for large datasets and modern multi-core CPUs.

Compared to Bubble Sort, this is far more efficient and scalable.
